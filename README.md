# CI-CD-Pipeline-with-cloudformation-and-github-actions
This is my first Case study with cloudformation (this project is actually a Single-tier-Application)
steps are below
- creat a repository
- creat a cloudformation template
- push the code
- add permision from your aws console
-connect your aws to your github by adding the access key and the secret key of your aws account. 
    opening your github account, open the repository you are working with, go to setting, go to secret then take action, add your access key and secret key.
- under my cloudformation.yaml i have just edited the bucket name, and the stack name
-test the project by checking your aws console to see if it created the stack 

this immage indicate that the project deployed successfully
